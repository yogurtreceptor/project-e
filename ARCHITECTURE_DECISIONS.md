# Architecture Decisions

This file records important architecture decisions for Operation Eddy.

Use it when a decision affects the long-term structure, direction or maintainability of the project.

Examples of decisions worth recording:

* choosing a backend framework
* choosing a database
* changing the entity model
* changing the relationship model
* adding a new major domain
* changing the Stage 1 scope
* introducing authentication
* introducing external integrations
* postponing AI, automation or decision support

Do not record tiny implementation details.

Each decision should use this format:

```text
## ADR-000: Short decision title

Status: Proposed / Accepted / Superseded

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Decision:
Briefly state the decision.

Reason:
Explain why this decision was made.

Consequences:
Explain what this enables, limits or changes.
```

New decisions should be added to the bottom of this file.

If a decision is replaced later, do not delete the old decision. Mark it as superseded and add a new decision below it.
